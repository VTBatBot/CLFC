# CLFC
Closed Loop Feedback Controller

This branch is developed by Nathan Cox to control the cameras used by the NVIDIA Jetson.

All files are intended to run in Python3. The needed libraries are
- RPi.GPIO:         (comes with the Jetson, no extra installation needed)
- OpenCV (cv2):     (needs to be installed from the internet, use "pip3 install cv2")
