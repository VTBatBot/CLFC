# Firmware for the Arduino Due

- **`daq_daq_goose`**: a data synthesis and acquisition program communicating
over USB serial with support for static and dynamic motion

- **`daq_daq_goose_no_output`**: `daq_daq_goose` but with no output waveforms
(i.e. no DAC). This allows for longer data collection times

- **`faster_than_light`**: proof-of-concept for performing real-time
acquisition while plotting on the host (theoretically "unlimited" collection
times)
